# Requirements
* Support lat, lon, alt, and time dimensions
* Support arbitrary stacking of coordinates (eg. lat_lon lat_time, lat_lon_time, alt_time, etc.)
* Support dimensions for coordinates, but allow overwriting to ignore dimensions
* Support different coordinate reference systems for lat, lon dimensions
* Support arbitrary start, end, steps that get filled with the native coordinates when requested
* Support intersection of coodinates
* Support addition of coordinates
* Support dropping coordintes
* Support replacement of coordinates for certain dimensions
* Support sub-selection of coordinates based on index
* Support multiple types of calculated, and explicitly labelled coordinates
    * This includes:
        * Explicit lists of coordinates
        * Uniform or linspace coordinates
        * Rotated coordinates
        * Mapped coordinates (mapping based on i/j(/k/l) index of data array)

# Example Use cases
1. I want to create a regularly spaced set of (lat, lon) coordinates
2. I want to create an irregularly spaced set of (time) coordinates
3. I want to create a rotated lat,lon coordinate system
4. I want to create a regularly spaced line of (lat_lon) coordinates
5. I have a set of native_coordinates, and I want to sub-select based on a window of coordinates. The step size of the native_coordinates should be preserved
6. I have a set of native_coordinates, but I only want every 5th element in the time dimension
7. I have a set of native_coordinates, but I want to replace the coordinates of the time dimension with a different coordinate
8. I have a set of (lat_lon) stacked coordinates but I want a new set of coordinates that describe a box containing all of these (lat_lon) coordinates -- this should be at the resolution of the lat_lon coordinates
9. I want to create (lat,lon) coordinates in UTM-feet using zone T18 with the NAD87 CRS
10. I want the intersection of the (lat,lon) coordinates in UTM-feet using zone T18 with the NAD87 CRS with another coordinate system using CRS WGS84 in geodetic coordinates. 
11. I want to specify a single (lat, lon) coordinate represented as a single point. Intersections with another coordinate should only give results at the point. 
12. I want to specify a single (lat, lon) coordinate representing an area of a certiain size (dlat, dlon). Intersections with another coordinate will give resoluts over this area.
