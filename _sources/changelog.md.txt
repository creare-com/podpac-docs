# Changelog

## 2.2.0
### Introduction

Wrapping Landsat8, Sentinel2, and MODIS data and improving interpolation.

### Features
* Added `datalib.satutils` which wraps Landsat8 and Sentinel2 data
* Added `datalib.modis_pds` which wraps MODIS products ["MCD43A4.006", "MOD09GA.006", "MYD09GA.006", "MOD09GQ.006", "MYD09GQ.006"]
* Added settings['AWS_REQUESTER_PAYS'] and `authentication.S3Mixing.aws_requester_pays` attribute to support Sentinel2 data
* Added `issubset` method to Coordinates which allows users to test if a coordinate is a subset of another one
* Added environmental variables in Lambda function deployment allowing users to specify the location of additional 
dependencies (`FUNCTION_DEPENDENCIES_KEY`) and settings (`SETTINGS`). This was in support the WMS service. 
* Intake nodes can now filter inputs by additional data columns for .csv files / pandas dataframes by using the pandas
`query` method. 
* Added documentation on `Interpolation` and `Wrapping Datasets`

### Bug Fixes
* Added `dims` attributes to `Compositor` nodes which indicates the dimensions that sources are expected to have. This 
fixes a bug where `Nodes` throw and error if Coordinates contain extra dimensions when the `Compositor` sources are missing
those dimensions.
* `COSMOSStations` will no longer fail for sites with no data or one data point. These sites are now automatically filtered. 
* Fixed `core.data.file_source` closing files prematurely due to using context managers
* Fixed heterogenous interpolation (where lat/lon uses a different interpolator than time, for example)
* `datalib.TerrainTiles` now accesses S3 anonymously by default. Interpolation specified at the compositor level are 
also now passed down to the sources. 

### Breaking changes
* Fixed `core.algorithm.signal.py` and in the process removed `SpatialConvolution` and `TemporalConvolutions`. Users now
have to label the dimensions of the kernel -- which prevents results from being modified if the eval coordinates are 
transposed. This was a major bug in the `Convolution` node, and the new change obviates the need for the removed Nodes, 
but it may break some pipelines. 


## 2.1.0
### Introduction

Fixing some bugs associated with AWS evaluation and the drought-monitor application

### Features
* Added `algorithm.TransformTimeUnits` algorithm to be able to utilize time in terms of `dayofyear`
* Added `Coordinates.transform_time` method to transform YYYY-MM-DD time units to something like `dayofyear`

### Bug Fixes
* Removed `region_name` from `authentication.S3Mixin` because it is not a valid argument
* Made the `algorithm.Mask` node simpler to JSON serialize
* Made `interpolator` tolerant of string-based timedelta values
* Added the `crs` to `Node` outputs if it is not present -- this caused issues with the `union` call in `Algorithm.eval`
* Fixed `data.Zarr`'s `open_consolidated` call. It was erroneously passing the `r` argument.


## 2.0.0
### Introduction

### Features
* Added `MODIS` datasource `datalib.modis_pds`
* Added `datalib.weathercitizen` to retrieve weathercitizen data
* Added `datalib.cosmos_stations` to retrieve soil moisture data from the stationary COSMOS soil moisture network
* Added `algorithm.ResampleReduce`, which allows users to coarsen a dataset based on a reduce operation (such as mean, max, etc.). 
* Added the `managers.parallel` submodule that enables parallel computation with PODPAC in a multi-threaded, multi-process, or multi-AWS-Lambda-function way
* Added the `managers.multi_process` submodule that enables PODPAC nodes to be run in another process.
* Added the `compositor.UniformTileCompositor` and `compositor.UniformTileMixin` to enable compositing of data sources BEFORE harmonization (so that interpolation can happen across data sources with the same coordinate systems)
* Added the `validate_crs` flag to `Coordinates` so that validation of the `crs` can be skipped if needed (this improved speed)
* Added `managers.aws.Lambda.eval_timeout` attribute so that Python will only wait a certain amount of time before returning from a invoke call.
* Added asynchronous evaluation of `managers.aws.Lambda` Nodes.  Note! This does not do error checking (e.g. exceeding AWS allocation f the number of allowed concurrent threads).
* Added `alglib.climatology`, which allows computation of Beta distribution fits to time series for each day of the year
* Added `core.algorithm.stats.DayOfYearWindow`, which is similar to `GroupReduce`, but also allows a window for the computation and only works for time
* `Coordinates` will now be automatically simplified when transformed from one `crs` to another. Previously, transformations always resulted in `DependentCoordinates`. This change adds the `.simply` method to some `Coordinates1d` classes.
* Improved performance of PODPAC AWS Lambda function by only downloading dependencies when the function is not already "hot". "Hot" functions retain the files in the `/tmp` directory of the Lambda function.
* `data.Zarr` will now use `zarr.open_consolidated` whenever the `file_mode='r'` for more efficient read operations on S3
* Added podpac's version to pipeline definitions

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed `algorithm.GroupReduce` to accept `dayofyear`, `weekofyear`, `season`, and `month`. It also now returns the time coordinate in one of these units. 
* Implemented a circular dependency check to avoid infinite recursion and locking up due to cache accessing. This change also defined the `NodeDefinitionError` exception.
* Fixed the `UnitsDataArray.to_format` function's `zarr_part` format to work propertly with parallel computations
* Added the `[algorithm]` dependencies as part of the AWS Lambda function build -- previously the `numexpr` Python package was missing

### Breaking changes
* Renamed `native_coordinates` to `coordinates`
* Deprecated `Pipeline` nodes
* Removed `ctype` and `segment_length` from `Coordinates`. Now specify the `boundary` attribute for `DataSource` nodes instead.
* Fixed `datalib.smap_egi` module to work with `xarray` version `0.15`
* Modified PODPAC's root setting directory from `~/.podpac` to `~/.config/podpac`
* Changed default cache behaviour to overwrite by default (prevents certain cache lock situations)
* Removed `datalib.airmoss` -- it was no longer working!

### Maintenance
* Refactored the way PODPAC keeps track of `Node` definition. Most all of it is now handled by the base class, previously `DataSource`, `Algorithm`, and `Compositor` had to implement specialized functions. 
* Refactored `datalib` nodes to prefer using the new `cached_property` decorator instead of `defaults` which were causing severe circular dependencies
* Refactored `DataSource` nodes that access files on S3 to use a common `Mixin`
* Refactored authentication to use more consistent approach across the library

## 1.3.0

### Introduction

The purpose of this release was to make the software more robust and to improve the Drought Monitor Application.

### Features

* Algorithm arrays can now be multi-threaded. This allows an algorithm with multiple S3 data sources to fetch the data 
  in parallel before doing the computation, speeding up the process. See #343
* Improvements to AWS interface. See #336
* Added budgeting / billing capability to manage AWS resources. See #361
* Added GeoTIFF export / import capability. Lots of work with geotransforms in the Coordinates object. See #364.
* Nodes can now have multiple output channels. This support multispectral or multichannel data. See #348.

### Bug Fixes

* When intersecting time coordinate of different precision, no intersection would result. See #344
* Fixed `Array` datasource serialization 55fcf30

### Breaking Changes

* The H5PY, CSV, and Zarr nodes interfaces were unified as such, the following attributes have changed:
    * datakey --> data_key
    * latkey --> lat_key
    * lonkey --> lon_key
    * altkey --> alt_key
    * timekey --> time_key
    * keys --> available_keys
    * CSV.lat_col --> lat_key
    * CSV.lon_col --> lon_key
    * CSV.time_col --> time_key
    * CSV.alt_col --> alt_key
