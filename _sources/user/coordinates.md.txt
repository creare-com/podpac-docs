# Coordinates

`Coordinates` are used to: 
1. Execute nodes which retrieve and process data
2. Define the coordinates of data sources

The interface for `Coordinates` are currently unstable. To peek at what we're thinking, 
see [Developer Coordinates Spec](../developer/specs/coordinates.md)

For now, see the [Notebook Examples](https://github.com/creare-com/podpac/tree/master/doc/notebooks) for examples of creating `Coordinates`.
